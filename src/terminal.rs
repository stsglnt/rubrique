//! Terminals: tmux sessions shown as tabs and listed in the explorer.
//!
//! tmux does the real terminal work (the shell, the screen, colors, vim and
//! agents). Rubrique mirrors the screen of a session and types into it, so
//! closing a tab or the app leaves the session and its programs running.
//! A `.tmux` file in a folder is a terminal too: opening it starts (or
//! reattaches to) a session in that folder.
